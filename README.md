# My Hyprland Dotfiles for Hyprland

A personal collection of configuration files and setup scripts for my Arch Linux.
Primarily tested with **Hyprland**, but many configs (e.g. Neovim, Alacritty, bash) are desktop-agnostic.
The Hyprland RICE is a mix of Catppuccin Mocha and other Catppuccin themes.

## Applying Configs

### Approach using Bootstrap.sh(Unstable)

First, change the permission of Bootstrap.sh if it's not an executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/bootstrap.sh
```

Then, just run the script file and hope an error does not occur:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```
**NOTE:** I have removed hyprland-bin from bootstrap.sh because it caused problems when I was testing my script in a VM, please refer to the original [Hyprland](https://wiki.hypr.land) website for instructions before running the bootstrap script file.

### Alternate Approach

The caveman approach I use is first backing up my current .config/ directory and .bashrc file:

```bash
mv ~/.config/ ~/.config_bak/
mv ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc_bak
```

Then, to copy-paste configs to their respective location:

```bash
mv ~/Dotfiles/.bashrc ~/ 
mv ~/Dotfiles/wal ~/.cache
mv ~/Dotfiles ~/.config
```

## Disclaimer

* Designed for personal useâ€”your mileage may vary on other systems.
* Some configs assume Wayland (Hyprland).
* If you think this will be easy copy-pasting, please mentally prepare yourself for some crying over missing dependencies and screaming at your terminal(In your mind) :)
